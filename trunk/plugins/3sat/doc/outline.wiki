

Prove that only tautological instances <= in length to twice the length of the longest canonical forumla + 1 ineed be considered.

Prove that rule set, when applied depth first to antecendents, will reduce any substitution instance of tautology with 3 or fewer variables.
    * Need list of tautologies 
    
Prove that the only way to reduce T->A to T is to reduce A to T.

Use Knuth-Bendix algorithm to prove that rule set is confluent.

Define System S.
