The Meteor Framework is a framework for building model-driven business applications.
Software modeling is a way to express what a software system should do without becoming mired in implementation details.<br>
Executable models are models that can be mechanically transformed into working software.<br>
<br>
The Meteor Framework uses the <a href='http://groovy.codehaus.org/'>Groovy programming language</a> to express executable models that can be run with Meteor's runtime engine.  <br>
By separating an application's model from its implementation Meteor makes it possible to create applications with much less effort than a traditional language-based framework.<br>
Pluggable 'capabilities' provide implementation-specific functionality like persistence, user interfaces, transactions, concurrency, etc.  Models must only describe details that are relevant to the application itself.<br>
<br>
But Meteor is about more than building applications, its also about maintaining and customizing applications.  Meteor's modeling language makes it possible to apply changes to an existing application without changing the original application.<br>
Meteor's modeling language is modular, so changes can be added and removed dynamically.<br>
<br>
Meteor leverages the Groovy language for modeling, making it possible for existing Java and Groovy developers to leverage their Java knowledge to create model-driven software.<br>
<br>
Meteor's ultimate goal is to make it possible to profitably produce high-quality, and easily extensible and customizable, bespoke software systems.<br>
