
Prove that if a->(b->c) is reducable then (a->b)->(a->c) is reducable.
Same as proving that if b->c is reducable then (a->b)->(a->c) is reducable.

Proof:
Suppose no subformula of (a->b)->(a->c) is reducable.
Our set of reduction rules contains the rule  (a->b)->(a->c) ==> a->(b->c).
Hence (a->b)->(a->c) will alsways be reduced.

Prove that only tautological instances <= in length to twice the length of the longest canonical forumla + 1 ineed be considered.

Prove that rule set, when applied depth first to antecendents, will reduce any substitution instance of tautology with 3 or fewer variables.
    * Need list of tautologies 
    
Prove that the only way to reduce T->A to T is to reduce A to T.


-------------------------
? NOT every tautology in L is a substitution instance of a tautology with no more than 3 variables.
A, A->B ==> B

1) c->(b->(a->T)), axiom C->(B->(A->T)) 
2) (c->(b->(a->T)))->(d->(c->(b->(a->T)))), axiom A->(B->A)
3) d->(c->(b->(a->T))), MP(1,2)
